user stories:

-Client 1 
    Twenty-thirty something office worker, who has extra 
    time to kill would enjoy this game either alone or with a friend.
    Also is takes little mental power to play. Great for zoning out.
    
-Client 2 
    a kid that surfs the web frequently and has a low cash flow, might
    play this game on the browser with their friends.
    
-Client 3
    Most likely a person of any age, who is interested in computer programming,
    would enjoy this game in order to learn more about how canvas is freaking
    cool yet at the same time an uphill battle to use.
